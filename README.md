This program simulates an Elevator controller for the amazing company Rocket Elevators!

It controls a Column of elevators.

It sends an elevator when a user presses a button on a floor and it takes the user to its desired floor when a button is pressed from the inside of the elevator.

the selection of the elevator is based on two parameters

The floor where the person is and the direction in which he wants to go (Up or Down)

An elevator already in motion (or stopped but that still has other requests to be complete) should be prioritized versus an "Idle" elevator.
